MovieStub is a quick project I created over the course of a day to get more familiar with AngularJS. Enjoy!

I primarily used AngularJS (with Node.js as a backend). Twitter Bootstrap was used for to achieve a basic responsive website.


This was a quick project over the course of a day to get more familiar with AngularJS. Enjoy!
