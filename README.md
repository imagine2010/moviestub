MovieStub is a quick project I created over the course of a day to get more familiar with AngularJS. I primarily used **AngularJS** (with **Node.js** as a backend). I used **Twitter Bootstrap** for a basic responsive website.

**User Stories:**
* User can search movies
  * *Note: MovieStub includes a static collection of movies. To see current movie data, check out one of my older projects which makes use of the MovieDatabase API: [Webflix] (http://movie-webflix.herokuapp.com/)*
* User can view movie summary
  * Move title
  * Movie poster
  * Movie summary
  * Number of tickets available
* User can view more information about a single movie
* User can "buy"[1] tickets via a booking system
* User can view tickets booked

[1] Tickets are not actually purchased or processed
